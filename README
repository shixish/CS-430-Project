I wrote this Android application as part of my CS 430 Operating Systems class.
It basically records some of the sensor data on my phone (accelerometer, etc), 
 then it was able to upload the data to my server where I attempted to render it using WebGL.

Not really practical for anything, but it allowed me to get familiar with making Android apps.
